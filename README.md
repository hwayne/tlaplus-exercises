# TLA+ Exercises

Some experiments in making exercises for teaching TLA+:

* Passfail: Exercises in finding useful properties. 
* Typeset: Exercises in generating useful sets.

<!-- Reverse property: give an initial setup and property and ask them to write a next -->
<!-- Why does this fail? What does the error trace looklike? -->
